Adds support for [Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg/) to Garfield Kart: Furious Racing. Currently a Work in Progress mod.

## APWorld

The APWorld for this mod can be installed [on this github repo](https://github.com/FeluciaPS/Archipelago/releases)

## Bug Reports

Please report any bugs or issues you find in [this channel](https://discord.com/channels/731205301247803413/1315673680155639848) in the Archipelago discord server.

## Installation

Ideally, use [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) or something like it.

If installing manually, use r2modman and select "Import Local Mod" after making a profile for Garfield Kart, then select the zipped file. It will then import it into your profile with dependencies.
